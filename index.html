        The first web browser was invented in 1990 by <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee
      </a>. It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was later renamed  Nexus. In 1993, Marc Andreesen created a
        browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), "the world's first
        popular browser", which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more accessible to the average person.
        Andreesen's browser sparked the internet boom of the 1990s. These are the two major milestones in the history
        of the Web.

        The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but showed how commercialization of the Web
        could stymie standards efforts. Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to
        HTML in their products, and tried to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the
        Cascading Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape's JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.

            The first <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie">Internet Explorer</a> was
            derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied
            on Spyglass as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser
            to Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually
            modeled on the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code.
            The license to Microsoft provided Spyglass (and thus NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's
            revenues for the software.

            In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8
            offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS,
            and Ajax, as well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to
            successfully pass the Acid2 test. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 included new features such as WebSlices and
            an improved phishing filter.

            The project which became
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?product=firefox-3.6.8&os=osx%E2%8C%A9=en-US">Firefox</a>
            started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been
            sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

            Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled
            by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range    form control attribute in
            HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction
            to have to "switch to a different search provider across  the entire browser," and a global browser console, a
            new network monitor among other things.

            Google's Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at
            the time, Google was a small company," and he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars." After
            co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of
            <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, however, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it
            essentially forced me to change my mind."
          </p>
          <p>
            In December 2010 Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an
            official Chrome MSI package. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be
            customized via transform files (.mst) - but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI wrapper
            fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet their needs.
